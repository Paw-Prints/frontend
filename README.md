# Paw Prints

[Paw Prints](https://optimistic-brattain-b3415e.netlify.com/) is a web application that helps potential dog adopters locate nearby dogs available for adoption and provides an estimated budget required to adopt. 

The American Humane Association found that [1 in 10 pets is no longer in their adoptive home just six months later](https://news.orvis.com/dogs/pet-adoption-statistics-the-numbers-behind-the-need), with one commonly cited reason for surrender being unexpected cost. 

Our goal is to inform potential adopters of the lifetime costs of dog ownership to reduce the rate of return. Our API provides monthly, annual and lifetime estimate costs based on dog breed as well as comparisons for average savings with pet insurance.

Paw Prints API was built with [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/en) with [Express](http://expressjs.com), integrating the [PetFinder API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/).
